# Word Pyramid

Word Pyramid is a game where players must form English words in each level of a pyramid using only the letters in the bottom row. The game features simple rules, allowing players to use up to 10 skips to bypass difficult letters. The player places letters by clicking on the tile where they want it to go, and once placed, they cannot remove it. Players lose the game if they are unable to form a word or if the word they form is invalid. 

# Rules of the game:

1) Each level of the pyramid must consist of an English word.
2) To form a word, you can only use the letters in the bottom row, located next to the "restart" and "skip" buttons.
3) If you encounter difficulties, you can skip up to 10 letters that don't work for you. However, after using all 10 skips, you must use the given letters.
4) If you cannot form a word in a level, or if the word formed is invalid, you lose the game. To win the game, follow rule number 1.
